# Branches
(Major branches of the QJak Entertainment Pack project)

## master
- Has most improvements, but may not have some improvements from
  2007-08-11 repack.


## 2007-08-11 repack
- The main changes in logic seem to be to JakSound, so this may be
  a version that was edited inside of a Windows 98 (or ME??) VM
  for a while (that copy was never quite exactly on pitch, though
  that was the main goal of that copy).
- Has improved setup using relative paths
- Has other improvement (see changelog in branch)
- **However**, seems to be based on an older version than 2007-08-09!
  - There are reversions to the readme that can't be found elsewhere,
    so the actual version it was based on is lost
    (must have been a version between 2007-08-03 and 2007-08-09).
